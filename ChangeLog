	* common/src/ivs_connection.cpp:
	* ica/src/demo_server.cpp:
	* ica/src/demo_server.h:
	use rectList instead of QRegion, should fix some X-errors on
	Linux/X11-version

	* common/include/rectlist.h:
	* common/src/rectlist.cpp:
	added lightweight and non-GUI-dependent class "rectList" as replacement
	for QRegion

2006-10-11	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* ima/src/main_window.cpp:
	connect power-down-all-button to clientManager::powerDownClients
	instead of clientManager::powerOffClients

	* ica/src/progress_widget.cpp:
	do not use semi-transparent progress-widget as it's horribly slow
	under win32

	* ica/src/service.cpp:
	do not call exit(0) at the end of ServiceStop() - win32-service-manager
	now properly detects if service had been stopped

	* ica/src/ica_main.cpp:
	- do not create QApplication in first invocation of ICAMain() when
	  running as service for not creating two QApplication-objects
	- bugfix: when settings up commandline for ICAMain() in WinMain() make
	  the first item to be the application-path - fixes several problems
	  when building against Qt 4.2.0 and running as service under win32

	* ica/src/remote_control_widget.cpp:
	more usable toolbar and toolbuttons

	* common/src/isd_connection.cpp:
	wait 1000 ms instead of 500 ms for connection to be established

	* ica/win32/src/vncService.cpp:
	in SimulateCtrlAltDelThreadFn(): if switching to winlogon-desktop
	failed, launch taskmgr manually

	* ica/src/system_key_trapper.h:
	* ica/src/system_key_trapper.cpp:
	- trap Alt+F4 under win32
	- detect Alt+Ctrl+Del-presses under win32

	* ica/src/vncview.cpp:
	* ica/src/vncview.h:
	- full support for level3-shift-key (AKA AltGr) and unicode-characters
	  such as euro-sign
	- unpress all modifiers when quitting

	* ima/src/client.cpp:
	- do not lock m_syncMutex when changing client-mode as it isn't
	  neccessary anymore and just causes senseless delays
	- only lock m_queueMutex where it is really needed, improves reaction-
	  time when changing client-mode as well

	* ima/src/client_manager.cpp:
	much smaller delay when changing global client mode in the hope this
	doesn't cause problems with demo-mode

	* ima/src/client.cpp:
	* ima/src/client_manager.cpp:
	set mainWindow::m_clientManager in constructor of clientManager, so
	code called out of it does not crash when using
	mainWindow::m_clientManager

2006-10-10	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* ica/src/system_key_trapper.cpp:

	under win32

	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	* ica/src/demo_server.cpp:
	* ica/src/demo_server.h:
	start demo-server on given port - bugfix

	* ica/Makefile.am:
	* ica/src/lock_widget.cpp:
	* ica/src/inject.cpp:
	* ica/src/inject.h:
	inject some code into winlogon.exe for safely disabling Secure Attention
	Sequence (SAS=Alt+Ctrl+Del) - much better than old solution which
	simply disabled task-mgr by security-policy

	* Makefile.am:
	* ica/src/ica_main.cpp:
	* utils-win32/HookNTQSI.dll:
	try to hide ICA-process using HookNTQSI.dll

	* ica/src/vncview.h:
	* ica/src/vncview.cpp:
	revised whole key-event-handling, especially handling of modifiers -
	now things like holding <Alt> while switching apps with <Alt>+<Tab> are
	supported, <Control>+<any key> is now recognized (e.g. Ctrl+C), under
	Linux/X11 native translation of X-keycodes is done when compiling with
	Qt >= 4.2.0

	* ica/src/vncview.cpp:
	- do not pass QX11BypassWindowManagerHint to parent-widget as this
	  causes troubles with Qt 4.2.0 and things work without it as well
	- when viewing remote desktop, update every 70ms instead of 80ms

	* ica/src/demo_server.h:
	* ica/src/demo_server.cpp:
	- sleep less between updates of demo-screen (20ms instead of 25ms)
	- do check for cursor-movements with GUI-thread-affinity and send
	  actual changes within thread in which socket to client was created

	* ica/src/ica_main.cpp:
	renamed parameters "-installservice" and "-removeservice" to
	"-registerservice" and "-unregisterservice"

	* common/include/isd_connection.h:
	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	introduced helper-class "isdForwarder" which is used by VNC-server-
	subprocess under Linux/X11 for forwarding all requests received by
	VNC-server to actual ISD-server in parent-process

	* ica/src/ica_main.cpp:
	* ica/src/ivs.cpp:
	* ica/src/ivs.h:
	* ica/src/demo_server.h:
	* ica/src/demo_server.cpp:

	* ica/src/isd_server.h:
	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	* ica/src/ivs.cpp:
	* ica/win32/src/vncClient.cpp:

	in isdServer static

	* common/include/ivs_connection.h:
	* common/src/ivs_connection.cpp:
	* ica/src/vncview.cpp:
	use QImage instead of QPixmap as image-container for cursor-shape
	which sometimes led to X-errors as dealing with QPixmap's in non-GUI-
	threads isn't safe

	* common/src/isd_connection.cpp:
	do not create QTcpSocket as child of isdConnection as isdConnection
	was created in another thread than the socket - fixes some bugs

	* common/include/italc_rfb_ext.h:
	* common/include/ivs_connection.h:
	* common/src/isd_connection.cpp:
	* common/src/ivs_connection.cpp:
	new authentication-mechanism: authentication via a file which is only
	readable by owner and over which challenge is transmitted

	* common/include/isd_base.h:
	* common/include/isd_connection.h:
	* common/include/local_system.h:
	* common/src/isd_connection.cpp:

	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	* ica/src/isd_server.h:
	* ima/src/main_window.cpp:
	port for demo-server is chosen before it is started - makes
	demoserver-port-info-response-message obsolete

2006-10-07	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* ima/src/snapshot_list.cpp:

	selected

2006-10-06	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* ima/src/client.h:
	* ima/src/client.cpp:
	enqueue all actions which need writing to socket and process queue by
	update-thread for using socket indeed only from one thread - supresses
	some warnings and maybe iTALC also runs better

	* ima/src/client_manager.cpp:
	sleep 2 seconds between mode-changes of clients for avoiding troubles
	with demo-server

	* ima/src/main.cpp:
	register quint16 as Qt-metatype at application-startup

	* ica/src/service.cpp:
	misc cleanups

2006-09-27	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	in updater-thread: only reload client if it is visible

	* ima/src/main.cpp:
	register meta-type QModelIndex

	* ima/src/support_widget.cpp:
	use dynamic_cast for casting layout, as Qt4-MinGW-X is now built with
	rtti-support and therefore doesn't make problems anymore

	* common/src/local_system.cpp:
	before trying to create path, check whether it already exists! makes
	it possible to make snapshots etc.

2006-09-18	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* ima/src/client.h:
	* ima/src/client.cpp:
	* ima/src/main_window.cpp:
	create threads for each client for reloading it instead of doing that
	in one loop in main-window-updater-thread - if one client hangs, it
	doesn't block the others anymore

	* common/include/isd_base.h:
	in socketDevice::socketDevice, pass Unbuffered-flag to open() for
	making iTALC work with Qt 4.2

	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	when doing host-based auth., pass _user-ptr to socket-dispatcher-call
	for getting peer address - fixes crash of ica when acting as
	demo-master

	* ica/x11/libvncserver/auth.c:

	* ica/src/isd_server.cpp:
	- bugfixes in support for host-based auth.

	* common/src/ivs_connection.cpp:
	when running for demo-purposes, use app-internal-auth-mechanism

	- first attempts to fix similiar bugs as in ivs.cpp (multithreading)
	- do a host-based auth. for demo-clients instead of app-internal

	* common/src/local_system.cpp:
	(Win32)
	as there're problems when using functions from netapi32.dll we can't
	use some functions we need for getUserName(), therefore this code has
	been moved to "userinfo"-utility which is called periodically by
	userPollThread - localSystem::currentUser() now returns what the
	userPollThread received when launching userinfo

2006-08-18	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	fixes with bool-vars

	* ima/src/config_widget.cpp:
