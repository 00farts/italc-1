2006-08-22	Tobias Doerffel	<tobydox/at/users/dot/sourceforge/dot/net>

	* common/src/ivs_connetion.cpp:

	* common/src/local_system.cpp:
	(Win32)
	as there're problems when using functions from netapi32.dll we can't
	use some functions we need for getUserName(), therefore this code has
	been moved to "userinfo"-utility which is called periodically by
	userPollThread - localSystem::currentUser() now returns what the
	userPollThread received when launching userinfo
