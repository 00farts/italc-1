TODO
=====

master:
- clientManager::cmdToVisibleClients: progressdialog-ptr as param

todo for 1.0.0:

- highlight duplicate items in user-list -> you can see instantly if several users logged in with the same account
- make iTALC more stable and fix bugs...


todo after 1.0.0:
- file-collecting and -distributing
- audio- and video-streaming support (mplayer/xine already implement something like that, maybe we can use them via an API...)
- modules for importing information about clients (name, IP, MAC-addres) -> LDAP, NIS, Subnet-Scan, XML- and CSV-file ...
- Chat-Management-System
