What is iTALC?
----------------

iTALC is a use- and powerful tool which lets you observe and remote-control
other clients in a Linux-network.  It aims to be a free and OpenSource version
of commercial and expensive programs like MasterEye.
iTALC was designed for usage in school. With iTALC, the teacher is able to see,
what the students are doing on their computers, without any need to walk around
in the classroom... You can also control the clients. For example you can show
a demo, help a person, lock/unlock the screen, halt/reboot, execute a sequence
of commands or login with SSH and much more...
