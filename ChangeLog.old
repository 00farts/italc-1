Since this change-log was started VERY late, almost everything up to 0.9.4 is more than incomplete and is only taken from rough looks over diffs between the versions...

0.9.7
- IVS is now based on x11vnc 0.7.2
- added support for thin-clients
- file-collecting/-distributing


0.9.6.2 (2005/05/17)
- improved artwork for better usability
- cleanups concerning naming -> client-groups are now classrooms (which is easier to understand toward teachers...)
- AUTHORS and COPYING for about-dialog are now also used as embedded resources -> removed about_dialog_data.cpp
- removed some unneccessary icons in master/italc/resources
- qt-metasources (moc-files) are now directly included into according cpp-file which decreases build-time
- fixed some security-issues concerning authentication
- now using own tool for embedding binary data -> for building iTALC there's no need for qembed anymore
- added italc-keygen tool, a nice small program for easily generating keys for iTALC-users by hand
- fixed bug concerning file-distributing by inserting user-name before ~ on client-side -> now the home of the user is used, even IVS is started as different user
- cleanups and source-code-cosmetics


0.9.6.1 (2005/05/09)
- made iTALC compatible with Qt-versions down to 3.0
- moved screenshot-dir into hidden .italc-dir
- replaced qmake-build-system by autotools-system, which makes the whole configuration much more flexible (configure!) and opens new possibilities like "make dist", "make rpm"/"make deb" and the automatic remake of according files after embedded resources have changed
- iTALC compiles now also without zlib, libjpeg and openssl -> added #ifdefs ... at several places
- wrote spec-file for building RPMs by invoking "make rpm" on a configured tree
- made C-files ANSI-C-compliant -> iTALC compiles now successfully with GCC 2.95
- RSA-crypt-lib is no longer written in C++ because it's also used by C-only-apps (e.g. IVS)
- added alternative code in master/icv/src/client_viewer_widget.cpp for supporting Qt < 3.3
- successfully tested iTALC (with autotools-managed source-tree) on Debian Sarge 3.1 (unstable), Mandrake 10.0, SuSE 9.x, Fedora Core 2 and Knoppix 3.1 - 3.7


0.9.6 (2005/05/03)
- added small delay between processing of clients-commands if started for more than one client, because e.g. demo-mode made problems, if all clients simultanous connected to IVS
- added further What's this texts to buttons, lists and so on -> now almost every button, list, window etc. should have a help-text
- bugs and problems with different client-sizes/-positions are now fixed by saving individual size for each client
- added new cool splash (SVG!) with nice fade-in-effect ;-)
- increased time-out for select() in rfbConnection::dataFromServer() from 10 ms to 1 s
- fixed bug "QImage::convertDepth: cannot convert NULL-image" at start
- reorganized source-tree -> client, common and master -> later one package can be made of each subdir
- added public-private-key-authentication
- continued improving usability
- splitted config-files -> there's one file with personal settings and one with global client-settings -> this file in every user's home-directory can be a link to one global file -> changes of IPs/MAC-addresses and so on are made quickly
- separated all system-/platform-dependent functions into systemEnvironment-namespace -> when porting iTALC, only these functions have to be reimplemented
- added progress-information-window on longer processes, like starting demo-mode on all clients etc. - not complete yet, because window-content is not drawn properly because there's no return to Qt's event-processing-loop and QApplication::eventLoop()->processEvents( QEventLoop::AllEvents, 100 ); or QApplication::flush(); doesn't help...
- removed platform-specific gcc-parameters out of qmake-project-files
- on the master you can now choose the network-interface with IP which should be used for showing a demo
- optimized a little bit in QImage-manipulation-functions


0.9.5
- internal devel-version, see 0.9.6 for details


0.9.4 (2005/03/01)
- ported KRFB to Qt, so that we have our now the iTALC-Client-Viewer which is used for helping a person -> replaces old vncviewer-solution
- iTALC is now one binary and doesn't use any other external resources
- started implementation of support-system
- started improving coding-style ("m_" for class-members; int myFunc( int _a ) instead of int my_func(int a) and so on... )


0.9.3
- internal devel-version, see 0.9.4 for details


0.9.2 (2005/01/07)
- no information available :-(


0.9.1 (2005/01/03)
- completely revised user-interface, there's now a sidebar with several workspaces, e.g. browser, screenshot-management, logged in users etc.
- backported KMultiTabBar to Qt for using it in iTALC-sidebar
- some system()-calls moved to utils::-namespace


0.9 (2004/12/17)
- iTALC should be more general and also work in other environments than my school...
- solved problems with jpeglib by separating it into extra namespace
- now you can set the update-interval of clients
- full username is shown in tooltip when moving mouse-cursor over client-windows
- added splash-screen
- client-manager isn't MDI-window anymore, instead it's positioned on the left side -> splitter


0.8 (2004/11/30)
- heavily improved stability of iTALC by using mutexes for RFB-connection within client
- double-click on client-window starts client-viewer of according client
- added very simple support for distributing file(s)


0.7 (2004/11/22)
- rename to iTALC (Intelligent Teaching And Learning with Computers)
- enhanced x11vnc by additional features, like starting program etc.
- added demo-mode
- added screen-locking
- added sending of messages


0.6 (2004/10/13)
- using now x11vnc, a VNC-server which allows access to current X-session 
- implemented RFB-Protokoll in iTALC
- no information available


0.5 (2004/10/??)
- client- and client-group-data is now saved in external XML-file (before we defined all that within source code..... )


0.? (2004/09/27)
- rename to Telcora (Tool for Extended Linux-Client Observation and Remote Administration)
- first official release


0.1 (2004/09/17)
- program was named BigBrother
- first version with static client-IPs in source -> screen data is copied via SCP from clients, where a script regularly makes screenshots in /tmp...
- < 20 KB of actual source code...
